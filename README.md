# Twitter Sentiment Analysis 
This project takes in a search query, looks up for some tweets related to that search query using Twitter API and categorises those tweets into positive or negative using Natural Language Processing.<br>
In addition to this, I created two maps showing the popularity of Java and Python across the globe. Links to these can be found on the landing page.
